# DiscordBot
A discord bot that is going to be able to do various different things such as: play music, obtain information related to certain games, and do 
  miscellaneous things. 

# Technology Stack 
  - Intellij IDEA: Used this IDE because its functionaly allows me to be able to write code efficiently. An example is how I used the Database Plugin within 
      the program in order quickly be able to query the database and error check. 
  - DataGrip: Allows me to easily create new tables as well as quickly changing values within a table to check for certain errors. 
  - Java: It's a language that I am extremely familiar in and wanted to use it for this project in order to expand my knowledge of Java. 
  - JDA: The Java Discord API library was used in order to remove the REST API layer that I am still not that well educated in. This allows me to be able to
      easily create a bot and focus on the things that I want to learn.
  - XAMPP: Contains a very easy way to create your own SQL (MariaDB) database on your computer. I used this to host my own server.
  - WebScraping Project: I created my own webscraping project that takes information from wiki pages for games that I  play. This information is then put into a database and used for this project. In the future I do want to to turn it into a API so that this code does not interact with the database, but instead interacts with the API. 

# Why I created this project
  - I had created a Python Discord bot about 3 years ago and never got around to adding in all the features I had ideas about because my programming wasn't 
      well developed yet. I now felt confident in my ability to learn and implement everything that I wanted to into my bot. I also wanted to refine the concepts
      that I had learned in college. Some of these concepts include: Creation & Manipulation of Databases, extracting and adding information into database through
      Java, putting into practice some of the design patterns I had learned such as: Singletons, Prototype, etc. While it was fun doing all of this, in the end
      I want to create a bot that gets used by my friends and me in a fun way while we are talking to each other.
      
# Problems that I have faced or am facing right now
  - Organization: The project organization is bad. While I attempted to organize the project, there needs to be more improvement made on the organization of
      where certain code should go and in what package. 
  - Comments: There is not a lot of comments on my files which is an issue because other people should understand my functions without needing to read
      every line of code. 
  - Best Practices: The need to re-write code is extremely important because there is messy code that I write in order to get to the solution of a problem that I am facing. When I return to it, I realize that the code was written badly and needs to be revised. I have already been applying this and have reduced 
      multiple lines of code into one function that allowed me to use it in many different parts of my code. I need to keep going through my code and finding those pieces of code that I can easily reduce.
